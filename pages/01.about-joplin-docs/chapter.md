# In a nutshell

The Joplin-docs objective is to unify the documentation. A user-friendly and qualitative area maintained by the community for new & advanced Joplin users. A place where official doc and extended doc (tip&tricks, howto) can live together.

Nowadays Joplin documentation is in a giant readme file and the rest is divided in the [Forum](https://discourse.joplinapp.org), official [website](https://joplinapp.org), [Discord](https://discord.gg/ha87Fu62) and [GitHub](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/tree/dev/readme). When discovering the project, itâ€™s a game of back and forth between those sources. The docs exist but is difficult to follow.

[Join us](https://discourse.joplinapp.org) on the  forum to continue the discussion, give a hand or share your thoughts about this initiative.
