The objective of the Documentation Center is to unify the Joplin documentation and have a reference point for everyone. We invite you to contribute to this wiki by adding general receipt, tip&tricks doubled tested.  A Documentation Center maintained by the community should help new & advanced users.

Feeback from a new Joplin user

For now Joplin documentation is "everwhere" mostly splitted in the [Forum](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/), official [website](https://joplinapp.org/), [Discourse](https://discord.gg/ha87Fu62) and [GitHub](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin). 

- The [Help](https://joplinapp.org/help/) and [FAQ](https://joplinapp.org/faq/) page on the webiste are confused and basic (no search, no tracking pages read).
- The FAQ page content structure is unclear.
- The forum is great for general discussion but make difficult to find The 'standard' tip or snippet in the posts.
- It's difficult to track Plugins progress or issues as most of the discussions is on the forum. The docs center could track plugins tips & how to.
-  Not so easy as it seems. More work to do than just import the current docs

Current features

- advanced search,
- keep track of visited pages,
