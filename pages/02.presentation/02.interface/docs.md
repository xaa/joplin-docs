## Cross-platform
Joplin is cross-platforms and available on **desktop** (Windows, macOS and Linux), **mobile** (Android and iOS) and **terminal** (Windows, macOS, Linux and FreeBSD).  

All  applications have similar user interface and can synchronise with each other.

## Interface
All applications have similar interface composed of three main panels:  
- **Sidebar** contains the list of your notebooks and tags, as well as the synchronisation status.
- **Note List** contains the current list of notes - either the notes in the currently selected notebook, the notes in the currently selected tag, or search results.
- **Note Editor** is the place where you write your notes.  There is a **Rich Text editor** and a **Markdown editor**. There is a Toggle Editor button available.
