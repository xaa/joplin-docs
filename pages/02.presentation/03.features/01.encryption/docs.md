Joplin supports end-to-end encryption (E2EE) on all the applications. E2EE is a system where only the owner of the notes, notebooks, tags or resources can read them. It prevents potential eavesdroppers - including telecom providers, internet providers, and even the developers of Joplin from being able to access the data. Please see the [End-To-End Encryption Tutorial](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/e2ee.md) for more information about this feature and how to enable it.

For a more technical description, mostly relevant for development or to review the method being used, please see the [Encryption specification](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/spec/e2ee.md).
