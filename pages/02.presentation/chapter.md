**Joplin** is a free, open source note taking and to-do application, which can handle a large number of notes organised into notebooks. The notes are searchable, can be copied, tagged and modified either from the applications directly or from your own text editor. The notes are in [Markdown format](#markdown).. 

The application is available for Windows, Linux, macOS, Android and iOS (the terminal app also works on FreeBSD). A [Web Clipper](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/clipper.md), to save web pages and screenshots from your browser, can be installed on [Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/joplin-web-clipper/) and [Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/joplin-web-clipper/alofnhikmmkdbbbgpnglcpdollgjjfek?hl=en-GB).
