## Importing from other applications

In general the way to import notes from any application into Joplin is to convert the notes to ENEX files (Evernote format) and to import these ENEX files into Joplin using the method above. Most note-taking applications support ENEX files so it should be relatively straightforward. For help about specific applications, see below:

* Standard Notes: Please see [this tutorial](https://programadorwebvalencia.com/migrate-notes-from-standard-notes-to-joplin/)
* Tomboy Notes: Export the notes to ENEX files [as described here](https://askubuntu.com/questions/243691/how-can-i-export-my-tomboy-notes-into-evernote/608551) for example, and import these ENEX files into Joplin.
* OneNote: First [import the notes from OneNote into Evernote](https://discussion.evernote.com/topic/107736-is-there-a-way-to-import-from-onenote-into-evernote-on-the-mac/). Then export the ENEX file from Evernote and import it into Joplin.
* NixNote: Synchronise with Evernote, then export the ENEX files and import them into Joplin. More info [in this thread](https://discourse.joplinapp.org/t/import-from-nixnote/183/3).
