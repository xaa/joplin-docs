## Search order

Notes are sorted by "relevance". Currently it means the notes that contain the requested terms the most times are on top. For queries with multiple terms, it also matters how close to each other the terms are. This is a bit experimental so if you notice a search query that returns unexpected results, please report it in the forum, providing as many details as possible to replicate the issue.

## Goto Anything

In the desktop application, press <kbd>Ctrl+P</kbd> or <kbd>Cmd+P</kbd> and type a note title or part of its content to jump to it. Or type <kbd>#</kbd> followed by a tag name, or <kbd>@</kbd> followed by a notebook name.
