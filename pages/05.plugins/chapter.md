# Plugins

The **[desktop app](http://local.joplin2/26/presentation/interface#desktop)** has the ability to extend beyond its standard functionality by the way of plugins. These plugins adhere to the Joplin plugin API and can be installed & configured within the application via the `Plugins` page in the [Configuration screen](https://github.com/laurent22/joplin/blob/dev/readme/config_screen.md). This menu allows the manual installation of the plugin using the single 'Joplin Plugin Archive' (*.jpl) file. Once the application is reloaded the plugins will appear within the plugins menu where they can be toggled on/off or removed entirely.

**Plugins list**: [https://github.com/joplin/plugins/blob/master/README.md](https://github.com/joplin/plugins/blob/master/README.md).
