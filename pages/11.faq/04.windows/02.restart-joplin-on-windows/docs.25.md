## How do I restart Joplin on Windows (so that certain changes take effect)?

If `Show tray icon` is enabled, closing the Joplin window does not quit the application. To restart the application properly, one of the following has to be done to quit Joplin:

- click `File` in the menu and then click `Quit`
- right-click on the Joplin tray icon and then click `Exit`

Additionally the Windows Task Manager can be used to verify whether Joplin is still around.
